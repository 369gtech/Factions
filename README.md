<h1>Factions</h1>

<p>Factions are all the different coin(s)/token(s) communities that most players are already apart off. We want to bring those communities to monoGames to work together, build out together and fight together. Faction will include Signum, Ethereum, DOGE, Solana, Zill, Koinos, Hive, Wax and BSC to start with but this may change and also when the game starts to expand we will add more factions.</p>

<p>Players connect their current wallets to log into the game, then the game automates their wallet to the game wallet or if your new to blockchain you will get the default wallet. That wallet(s) you have chosen will automate your profile to that factions so if your an Ethereum wallet holder you are connected to the Ethereum Faction Community where you will be introduced to the Faction Leader, Faction Council Members, Faction Forum Lounge (social lounge), Portal Faction Land, your personal Comic Book, a set of faction guides to help you play, grow and improve your social standings to eventual have an opportunity to be a leader or council member.</p>

<p>If you have multiple wallets we will be giving players options to join more than one community with special monoAvatar Matrix nftâ€™s. We hope Factions create a really close knit community together especially when the whole community has to rely on one another to fulfill requirements to complete faction goals to help create new reward nft's for that faction which will be expanded as the game expands.</p>
